# A defaultdict is a dictionary with a default value for keys, so that keys for which no value has been explicitly
# defined can be accessed without errors. defaultdict is especially useful when the values in the dictionary are
# collections (lists, dicts, etc) in the sense that it does not need to be initialized every time when a new key is used.
