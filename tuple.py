# A tuple is similar to a list except that it is fixed-length and immutable. So the values in the tuple cannot be changed
# nor the values be added to or removed from the tuple. Tuples are commonly used for small collections of values
# that will not need to change, such as an IP address and port. Tuples are represented with parentheses instead of
# square brackets

ip_address = ('10.20.30.40', 8080)

# The same indexing rules for lists also apply to tuples. Tuples can also be nested and the values can be any valid
# Python valid.
