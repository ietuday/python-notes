# 1 The class is made up of attributes (data) and methods (functions).

# 2 Attributes and methods are simply defined as normal variables and functions.

# 3 As noted in the corresponding docstring, the __init__() method is called the initializer. It's equivalent to the
# constructor in other object oriented languages, and is the method that is first run when you create a new
# object, or new instance of the class.

# 4 Attributes that apply to the whole class are defined first, and are called class attributes.

# 5 Attributes that apply to a specific instance of a class (an object) are called instance attributes. They are
# generally defined inside __init__(); this is not necessary, but it is recommended (since attributes defined
# outside of __init__() run the risk of being accessed before they are defined).

# 6 Every method, included in the class definition passes the object in question as its first parameter. The word
# self is used for this parameter (usage of self is actually by convention, as the word self has no inherent
# meaning in Python, but this is one of Python's most respected conventions, and you should always follow it)

# 7 Those used to object-oriented programming in other languages may be surprised by a few things. One is that
# Python has no real concept of private elements, so everything, by default, imitates the behavior of the
# C++/Java public keyword. For more information, see the "Private Class Members" example on this page

# 8 Some of the class's methods have the following form: __functionname__(self, other_stuff). All such
# methods are called "magic methods" and are an important part of classes in Python. For instance, operator
# overloading in Python is implemented with magic methods
# Instances
kelly = Person("Kelly")
joseph = Person("Joseph")
john_doe = Person("John Doe")

# Attributes
print(kelly.species)
print(joseph.species)
print(john_doe.species)
print(kelly.name)
print(joseph.name)
print(john_doe.name)

# Methods
print(kelly.__str__())
print(joseph.__str__())
print(john_doe.__str__())
print(john_doe.rename("John"))


# Python has class methods and static methods â€“ special kinds of methods. Class methods work the same
# way as regular methods, except that when invoked on an object they bind to the class of the object instead of to the
# object. Thus m.__self__ = type(a). When you call such bound method, it passes the class of a as the first
# argument. Static methods are even simpler: they don't bind anything at all, and simply return the underlying
# function without any transformations
